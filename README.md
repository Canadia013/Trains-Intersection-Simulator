# Trains-Intersection-Simulator
Work in Progress, Project to randomly place trains on a cardinal grid system, and ensure collisions don't happen before all trains make it to their destinations

# Notes
This was originally designed as a project for a KSU Course, to simulate a real-time system checking and reacting to positions of trains to ensure they don't collide.
